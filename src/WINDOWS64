	Windows 64 compilation/installation instructions

NB: Please read the src/WINDOWS file first !

This file only documents the 64 bits specific part.

The preliminar port to Win64 has been done in Jan 2011 by
Jasper Taylor <jasper@simulistics.com>. Many thanks to him !
I have then added some finishing touches.

I have tested it under x86-64/Windows 7. I use cygwin as compilation
environment (see file WINDOWS). I used mingw-w64 which delivers a complete
toolchain (runtime, headers, and libs) for developing 64 bit (x64), as well
as 32 bit (x86), windows applications using gcc. It possible to get mingw-w64
from http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/ or, for cygwin, with the cygwin setup.exe 
utility (selecting the mingw package).

With the cygwin package things are installed in:

   /usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/  and in  /usr/i686-w64-mingw32/
      bin
      lib
      lib64
      sys-root
      sys-root/mingw
      sys-root/mingw/bin
      sys-root/mingw/include
      sys-root/mingw/lib

the toolchain executables are all prefixed with:

   x86_64-w64-mingw32 (e.g. x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc.exe) 

and with

   i686-w64-mingw32   (e.g. i686-w64-mingw32-gcc.exe)



Configuration
-------------

Open a Cygwin shell and go to GNU Prolog source directory:

type 
    ./configure --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32

NB: with this configuration all needed tools (gcc, ar, ...) are first searched 
prefixed with x86_64-w64-mingw32 (as provided by the cygwin package).

then
    make
    make check
    make install


LIMITATIONS
-----------

Currently hardware detection of stack overflows does not work 
(SEH is not yet implemented in mingw64).
