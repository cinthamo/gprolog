sparc/sunos:
 	under SunOs <= 4.1.2 even if the processor is a supersparc, the gcc
	option -msupersparc cannot be used in CFLAGS_MACHINE. The configure
	script omits it. 
	Thus integer multiplication and division is very slow...


sparc/solaris:
	you should be able to access as/ld/ar/ranlib maybe you should
	add /usr/ucb:/usr/ccs/bin/ ar something similar to your PATH variable


ix86/win32 with Cygwin:
	timmings system_time is always 0 and user time = real time
	buffering not implemented (after setvbuf each read returns EOF)
	sockets (AF_UNIX not supported with old versions of CYGWIN, modify
        file BipsPl/sockets_c.c or use --disable-sockets)
	stack overflow detection does not work

ix86/win32 with VC++ 6.0:
	sockets not implemented
	shell/2 and system/2 do not return correct error code 
        (due to command.com bad interpreted)
        popen/3 does not work (due to command.com)
	exec/5 does not work (due to command.com)
        send_signal/2 (does not work apparently)
        select/5 only implemented with sockets (to test more deeply)

ppc/linux:
	with no optimization options for gcc do not use global registers
	(use: ./configure --with-c-flags=debug --disable-regs)

ix86/FreeBSD (OpenBSD ?):
	linedit is not yet supported, use --disable-linedit when 
	using ./configure
	check before (this is maybe no longer true)

ix86/sco:
	On SCO UnixWare use --host=i586-pc-sco when using ./configure
	(until autoconf is updated to recognize UnixWare).
