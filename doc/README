1- Contents of this directory
-----------------------------

This directory contains the source of the manual written in LaTeX and several
target versions:

   - manual.dvi  (DVI version)
   - manual.pdf  (PDF version)
   - manual.ps   (PostScript version)
   - manual.html (HTML version entirely in one page)
   - manual.chm  (Compressed HTML used by MS HTMLHelp under Win32)

The Html directory contains the HTML version in several pages
(files index.html, manual*.html)

An on-line HTML version is also available at 
http://gprolog.inria.fr/manual

By default, the installation procedure copies each version in a directory
INSTALL_DIR/doc (see file ../INSTALL for more details).



2- Rebuilding the manual
------------------------

Each version can be reconstructed using the Makefile (type 'make help' for
a brief summary of available targets). Be sure to have the following environment before trying to rebuild the manual:

   - LaTeX2e (with standard packages) is needed to rebuild the DVI version.
   - dvips is needed to rebuild the PostScript version from the DVI.
   - pdflatex is needed to rebuild the PDF version.
   - HeVeA (version >= 1.06) is required to rebuild the HTML version.
     HeVeA can be obtained at http://pauillac.inria.fr/~maranget/hevea/
   - The HTML Help compiler is needed to rebuild the HTML Help version
     (see below).



3- The HTML Help Version
------------------------

Microsoft® HTML Help (HH for short) is the standard help system for the Win32
platforms (replacing old WinHelp). It is mainly based on HTML files + add-ons
(table of contents, index, search facilities,...). A SDK is freely available
as a "HTML Help Workshop". To obtain more information and/or the workshop
consult:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/vsconHH1Start.asp

To install the workshop: download and install the file HTMLHELP.EXE and add
to your PATH variable the PATH of the installed workshop.
E.g: create a hhvars.bat
@echo off
echo Setting environment for using HTML Help Workshop.
PATH=%PATH%;"C:\Program Files\HTML Help Workshop"

The HH version of the manual is constructed from the HTML files
(Html/index.html and Html/manual*.html) using a HH project (.hhp) which
includes a HH table of contents (.hhc) and a HH index (.hhk). The .hhc and
.hhk files are constructed wih HeVeA (from ) thanks to the script
hh_do_hhc_hhk. The result is a compressed (or compiled) HTML file (.chm).

NB: The user does not need the entire HTML Help Workshop to view a .chm, only
a runtime called "Help Viewer" is necessary. It is provided with some
versions of windows (e.g Windows XP). Else a viewer can be downloaded (file:
HHUPD.EXE) from the same URL (also available in C:\Program Files\HTML Help
Workshop\REDIST).
