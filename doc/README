                            GNU-Prolog Documentation


1- Contents of this directory
-----------------------------

This directory contains the source of the manual written in LaTeX and several
target versions:

	- manual.dvi (DVI version)
	- manual.pdf (PDF version)
	- manual.ps  (PostScript version)

The Html directory contains the HTML version (index.html, manual*.html)

An on-line HTML version is also available at 
http://gprolog.inria.fr/manual

By default, the installation procedure copies each version in a directory
INSTALL_DIR/doc (see file ../INSTALL for more details).



2- Rebuilding the manual
------------------------

Each version can be reconstructed using the Makefile (type 'make help' for
a brief summary of available targets). Be sure to have the following environment before trying to rebuild the manual:

   - LaTeX2e (with standard packages) is needed to rebuild the DVI version.
   - dvips is needed to rebuild the PostScript version from the DVI.
   - pdflatex is needed to rebuild the PDF version.
   - HeVeA (version >= 1.05) is required to rebuild the HTML version.
     HeVeA can be obtained at http://pauillac.inria.fr/~maranget/hevea/
